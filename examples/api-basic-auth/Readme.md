# HTTP API WITH BASIC AUTH

THIS IS A [HTTP API](HTTPS://WWW.WINGLANG.IO/DOCS/STANDARD-LIBRARY/CLOUD/API)  EXAMPLE AUTHENTICATING WITH BASIC AUTH. IT'S ALSO MAKING USE OF LEVERAGING [EXTERNAL](HTTPS://WWW.WINGLANG.IO/DOCS/LANGUAGE-REFERENCE#52-JAVASCRIPT) JAVASCRIPT - IN THIS CASE FOR BASE64 EN/DECODING. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, IT'S ENCAPSULATING THE BASIC AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONALITY INTO A DEDICATED [CLASS](HTTPS://WWW.WINGLANG.IO/DOCS/EXAMPLES/CLASSES).

SINCE THIS EXAMPLE MAKES USE OF EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT, IT WON'T RUN IN THE [WING PLAYGROUND](HTTPS://WWW.WINGLANG.IO/PLAY) YET.
