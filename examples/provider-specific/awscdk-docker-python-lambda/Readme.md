# DOCKER BASED AWS LAMBDA FUNCTION FOR THE AWS CDK TARGET

THIS ISN'T LEVERAGING THE WING SDK, BUT USING CONSTRUCTS FROM THE AWS CDK DIRECTLY VIA [BRING](HTTPS://DOCS.WINGLANG.IO/REFERENCE/SPEC#4-MODULE-SYSTEM). THAT'S WHY THE [PACKAGE.JSON](./PACKAGE.JSON) FILE IS PRESENT AND REFERENCING THE `AWS-CDK-LIB` PACKAGE.

THIS IS LARGELY BASED ON AN EXAMPLE BY [MARCIO CRUZ](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/MARCIOCADEV) WHO CONTRIBUTED THE AWS CDK PROVIDER FOR WING.

## PREREQUISITE

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE A CURRENT AND WORKING SETUP OF THE [WING CLI](HTTPS://DOCS.WINGLANG.IO/GETTING-STARTED/INSTALLATION).

## USAGE

NB: IN CASE OF A GLOBALLY INSTALLED WING CLI, THE `AWS-CDK-LIB` PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED GLOBALLY AS WELL. SEE THIS [ISSUE](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/WINGLANG/WING/ISSUES/2478) FOR MORE DETAILS.
