## PREREQUISITE

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE A CURRENT AND WORKING SETUP OF THE [WING CLI](HTTPS://DOCS.WINGLANG.IO/GETTING-STARTED/INSTALLATION)

## USAGE

SINCE THIS IS NOT USING THE WING SDK, IT NEEDS TO BE TESTED VIA THE `TF-AWS` TARGET.

### WING CONSOLE

THIS WILL SHOW YOU THE DIAGRAM, BUT THERE'S NO INTERACTION POSSIBLE.

```
WING IT
```

### WING TESTS

```
WING TEST -T TF-AWS --DEBUG  MAIN.W
```
